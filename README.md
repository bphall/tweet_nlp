## Introduction
This project was conducted in early April, 2020, during the rise of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The aim was to collect tweets over the course of a few days, and use an LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to find distinct, coherent 'topics' which those tweets belonged to. For example, expected topics included tweets relating to 'Trump', 'Economy', 'Healthcare', etc. 

Topic modelling in this way can confirm our intuitions about the variety, and volume, of dialogue happening in real time in social media space. LDA modelling allows for a single document (or tweet, in this case) to belong to multiple topics, such as both 'Trump' and 'Economy', if a tweet included Donald Trump addressing an economic topic. Five distinct and human-coherent topics were found: 
- Trump
- Economy
- Public Health
- Employment
- UK/Boris Johnson

Each topic was then analyzed for sentiment to show the overall social media 'mood' concerning that topic (positive, negative, neutral). 
 

## Data Collection and Cleaning <a name='data'></a>
The python library 'twint' was used to collect 100,000 tweets related to 'coronavirus'. The tweets were filtered by removing tweets shorter than 9 words, since those tweets were considered too short to be useful, and presumably included images, videos, or other media outside the scope of NLP. The tweets were then lower-cased, punctuation-removed with regex, tokenized, and analyzed for sentiment using Vader sentiment analyzer, a pre-trained model for capturing social-media specific sentiment. The tweets were further filtered by removing tweets with neutral sentiment, since many neutral tweets were journalistic in nature, and didn't contribute to naturally-occuring topics from independent Twitter users.


## EDA <a name='eda'></a>
The following shows general information about the tweets collected.

## LDA Model <a name='model'></a>
LDA, or Latent Dirichlet Allocation, creates a 'generative probabilistic model' which is similar to K-means clustering, but allows for multiple memberships, or 'fuzzy' memberships. So a tweet involving 'Trump' and 'Economy' will, based on other words in the tweet, have a maximum probability corresponding to one of them. In this case, *five* distinct topics were chosen because, despite more potential topics (and some higher 'coherence' scores), five topics created the most human-intelligible categories of tweets. Custom stop words were added to the base NLTK stop word set, and accreted continuously after multiple iterations of the model when it became clear that certain high-volume words were not contributing to distinct topics, words such as 'virus', 'corona', and 'covid'.

## Results <a name='results'></a>
The following shows the five topics which emerged from the LDA model, with the accompanying most-representative words for that topic based on TD-IDF, or 'Term Frequency â€” Inverse Document Frequency'. This is a common measure of semantic 'importance' in NLP. If a word appears far more often in one set of documents in comparison to the total set of documents, that word is considered more informative and representative of that set of documents.
### ![topics](topics.png)
The following shows the average sentiments belonging to those topics using the Vader sentiment analyzer, which was calculated retroactively on the original tweets after they were re-organized into their respective topics.

## WordCloud <a name='wordcloud'></a>
The WordClouds for each topic can be found in the full presentation or notebook, but the following is a particularly interesting and representative WordCloud of a single 15-minute period on the morning it was announced that Boris Johnson tested positive with the coronavirus.
